Regarding the issue of the implementation of information technology, one of the innovations currently widely used in SMEs is the implementation of social media, so it is important to identify aspects of social media usage. Previous theoretical and empirical evidence has revealed that the Technology-Organizational-Environment (TOE) framework has become a popular model for examining various issues of implementing information technology innovations and finding antecedents in the information systems domain. Besides the implementation of social media, the existence of Business Process Management (BPM) in SMEs plays an important role in maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's operations. BPM is an involved process and requires many technical and non-technical capability aspects. Most previous research focused on the technical capability aspects of business processes less successfully applied in Indonesian SME conditions. This study aims to analyze the non-technical capabilities of BPM that have yet to be studied in previous research. The data was collected by analyzing the results of interviews and observations on two garment SMEs in Surabaya, Indonesia. The contribution of this research is to provide new knowledge and studies on the relationship of the non-technical capabilities of BPM to the implementation of social media in SMEs. The results show the linkage between non-technical capabilities aspects and the implementation of social media in information search and sharing, marketing and branding, and playing an important role in customer relations.","2023","2025-03-12 00:49:23","2025-03-12 00:49:23","","489–497","","","","","","","SIET '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Badung, Bali, Indonesia","","","","business process management; non-technical capabilities; SMEs; social media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on generating several traces collected in a log from declarative temporal models by pre-emptively representing those as a specific type of finite state automaton: we show that this task boils down to a single-source multi-target graph traversal on such automaton where both the number of distinct paths to be visited as well as their length are bounded. This paper presents a novel algorithm running in polynomial time over the size of the declarative model represented as a graph and the desired log's size.

The complexity of understanding business processes is reduced when they are analyzed through process models. Problem: While many techniques assist and automate process modeling, the same is different for process analysis, which may reduce the effectiveness and consistency of BPM in improving business processes. Solution: This paper reports on our methodology to train a machine learning algorithm to automatically analyze process model elements (e.g., activities, swimlanes, data objects) and classify them according to three categories of infrastructure information: (i) process participants; (ii) processed documents and information; (iii) systems, technologies and tools. IS Theory: This work was conceived under the aegis of Organizational Learning Theory. The training of machine learning models seeks improvement over previous analysis methods through experimentation. Method: The research described in this paper is prescriptive and quantitative, organized through four phases: (i) model collection; (ii) dataset building; (iii) data evaluation; (iv) machine learning classifier development. Summary of Results: From a collection of 85 process models, three training datasets were created, with an average of 480 process activities each. We obtained accuracies between 88% and 96% depending on the category analyzed. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The main contribution of this research is the methodology developed to help automate business process analysis through machine learning training datasets and models.

Faced with this problem, it was decided to make a model based on the combination of two methodologies, Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) and Business Process Management (BPM). The proposed model was implemented in a Peruvian SME company in the retail commercial sector. In the analysis of the company, it was possible to identify the problems of the company, of which it was decided to solve two of them. As a proposed solution to the chosen problems, a restructuring of the collection policy was carried out.

At the same time, the pressure on existing professions is being exacerbated by demographic trends in industrialized countries. This reveals the potential offered by process automation in the administrative area. Technological progress can help to overcome this situation. In the recent past, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), automating simple and rule-based tasks, gained traction. RPA alone is not sufficient for more complex tasks. Therefore, supplementing or substituting AI-based technologies such as Machine Learning up to fully autonomous AI solutions, which we refer to as Intelligent Automation at its highest level, can be adopted. While RPA is regarded as an established technology, Intelligent Automation is still in its infancy. Therefore, research on successful practical examples is necessary for its dissemination. To this end, this paper conducts a qualitative multiple case study analysis based on guided semi-structured interviews aiming to identify success factors in the adoption of Intelligent Automation. To unravel the key factors, a framework comprising 45 success factors is introduced. This framework, along with its novelty to the scientific community, has the potential to facilitate practical implementation of Intelligent Automation. Yet, our investigation revealed that the identified use cases in the analyzed companies haven't reached the maturity level expected for Intelligent Automation. Consequently, the findings pertain to the early stages of Intelligent Automation development. This study distinguishes itself from prior research by incorporating additional cases from various institutions and sectors, utilizing a study design rooted in a broader scientific knowledge base. Given that a limited number of companies could be recruited despite extensive systematic acquisition efforts, this subject area deserves further research efforts.","2024","2025-03-12 00:49:23","2025-03-12 00:49:23","","8–14","","","","","","","ICCTA '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vienna, Austria","","","","BPM; Business Process Management; Artificial Intelligence; Empirical Study; Framework; Intelligent Automation; IPA; Process Automation; Qualitative Study; Semi-structured Interviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, companies in this sector seek to innovate their processes, become more efficient and competitive. In this sense, Lean Service and BPM stand out for generating efficiency and competitiveness in Back Office processes, through a focus on optimizing the value of processes, eliminating activities and reducing waste. In this case study, the aim is to increase the efficiency of the process of issuing electronic receipts in a Peruvian Banking and Insurance company, through the implementation of Lean and BPM tools such as: electronic 5s, digital Poka Yoke, load balancing and BPMN. Our proposal model includes the aforementioned Lean Service and BPM tools, which together achieve the reduction of rework, reduction of time in operation and reduction of overtime, which translates into increased process efficiency. Although more and more companies are applying Lean tools in the Services sector, there are still few precedents for their application in the Banking and Insurance sector. In this sense, the novelty of our proposal is the application of a model that combines Lean and BPM tools, such as Poka Yoke and electronic 5s in a digital work environment, obtaining favorable results.

Even though Situational Method Engineering (SME) can provide an additional layer of constitutional knowledge, it hasn’t been explored as deeply as other traditional methods. Strategies that rely on a so-called “situational context” make use of the atomic conceptual entities known as method chunks and/or fragments from the field of Situational Method Engineering (SME). BPM, on the other hand, describes processes through representational tools that have been thoroughly used in industry and established as reliable. All of these designs have advantages and disadvantages. We analyzed several designs and proposed a synthesized framework (metamodel) that combines their strong points, while also providing a way to objectively quantify and restructure the performance of a pre-existing process/product (or optimize the creation of an entirely new one).

Digital technologies such as Process Mining (PM) or Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which are becoming more and more prevalent, offer new possibilities for process analysis, monitoring, and automation. PM can further be helpful in identifying processes that are suitable for RPA. However, purely applying PM at the business data level often does not produce all the details required to assess RPA suitability. These necessary details can be supplemented by Task Mining (TM), a technology that can analyze tasks at a desktop data level, which opens further potential beyond the automation benefits. However, the currently available scientific literature on TM is scarce and empirical qualitative studies or case studies on the adoption of TM technology from a BPM perspective are missing. Therefore, this paper develops a fundamental framework for TM technology adoption based on a qualitative empirical study involving experts via semi-structured interviews, which are analyzed according to the qualitative content analysis based on the methodology of Mayring. The framework relates five potential benefits, two opportunities, four risks, and four basic requirements identified from the qualitative study. It thus provides a new valid starting point for future research efforts and serves as a guideline for managers in practice to evaluate a potential TM deployment in the company.","2023","2025-03-12 00:49:23","2025-03-12 00:49:23","","50–59","","","","","","","ICCTA '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vienna, Austria","","","","BPM; Business Process Management; Empirical Study; Framework; Qualitative Study; Semi-structured Interviews; Process Mining; Robotic Process Automation; RPA; Task Mining Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has increased competition in this sector from the emergence of new proposals such as Uber or Rappi, which is why Courier companies are having problems maintaining the loyalty of their customers. It is important then, to differentiate yourself and a good way to do it is by improving the management of non-conforming orders, since several studies indicate that if you sell online, you must be prepared to receive an average return´s ratio of 20% of the products depending on the sector. A good way to improve this process is with the application of the lean philosophy to eliminate activities that do not generate value, in conjunction with the BPM methodology to have a better global control of the process, identify repetitive activities and determine the relevant KPIs for the company. That is why this paper proposes a model with the application of these 2 methodologies to improve customer loyalty in a courier company. The implementation of the proposed model and its improvements were simulated using the software Arena and compared with the initial situation. The results showed the effectiveness of the method, reducing the service time of non-compliant orders by 37%.

Current methods for producing prefix-alignments are computationally expensive and hinder the applicability in real-life settings.This paper introduces a new approximate algorithm - I Will Survive (IWS). The algorithm utilizes the trie data structure to improve the calculation speed, while remaining memory-efficient. Comparative analysis on real-life and synthetic datasets shows that the IWS algorithm can achieve an order of magnitude faster execution time while having a smaller error cost, compared to the current state of the art. In extreme cases, the IWS finds prefix-alignments roughly three orders of magnitude faster than previous approximate methods. The IWS algorithm includes a discounted decay time setting for more efficient memory usage and a look-ahead limit for improving computation time.

Particularly in Industry 4.0, blockchains can be employed to monitor the movement of goods and materials across the supply chain, ensuring data integrity, transparency, immutability, accountability, and industrial process interoperability. Industry 4.0 companies must interact with various external players, which often requires collaborations and partnerships to access new technologies, shared data and analytics, and required resources for their processes. However, current business process management in the industry is mostly centralized, untraceable, unreliable and lacks automation. Smart contracts hold the potential to tackle these concerns by offering a remarkable level of automation, transparency, and security while also aiding in regulatory compliance. However, the adoption of smart contracts in Industry 4.0 is still limited due to various obstacles. The challenges facing the deployment of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in Industry 4.0 are multifaceted, encompassing issues such as interoperability across different blockchain systems, scalability and performance constraints, limitations on ensuring data privacy, difficulties in accessing external data sources, and the significant transaction costs often associated with executing smart contracts. To tackle these obstacles comprehensively, we advocate for the development of an interoperable consortium blockchain framework tailored to meet the versatile business processes required by Industry 4.0 enterprises or groups. This proposed architecture, distinct from any specific internal system, incorporates private channels and ensures secure access to external data, thus addressing broader interoperability concerns beyond just smart contracts. Our goal is to establish a comprehensive DLT framework that assures data integrity and traceability throughout its lifecycle, from creation and processing to its final utilization for business insights. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through its application in a real-world industrial scenario, undertaken in partnership with Fagor Automation, a global leader in the industrial sector.","2024-12","2025-03-12 00:49:24","2025-03-12 00:49:24","","","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Industry 4.0; Blockchain; Smart Contracts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The motivation for the project presented is to conceptualise a business process as an aesthetic medium that enriches companies, society, and individual lives with new ideas of beauty. For this, it is important to make the spectrum of business processes visible by no longer understanding business processes as exclusively technical systems. In his works, the Nobel Prize winner for literature John Steinbeck focuses on the milieu of simple workers and yet recognises ""And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world.""Visualising. Business process management seeks to understand processes by reducing them to their essential actions, studying them, and making the interplay of those actions as efficient and effective as they can be. This reductionist approach extends to visualising as the chosen method of this project as well. A pattern language will be recreated that enables visual learning in education at universities and in companies. The patterns of this pattern language enable us to explore the essence of processes by developing a holistic view of them, communicating them, and finally, creating them for businesses.PatternPool. In a recent experiment conducted at the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, students of mechanical engineering, together with industry partners, were asked to visualise the spectrum of business processes, and identify the first patterns and link them in a pattern language. A PatternPool database was created for the explication, documentation, and dissemination of the patterns as best practices.Visual learning. Through these patterns, knowledge in the world can be combined with knowledge in our heads, and the intangibility of processes can be visualised. Collective inspiration can be set free through learning together from past experience and from others. Therefore, a concept for visual learning based on the pattern approach is to be developed for business process management.Creativity. The true value of the project is revealed when we understand business processes holistically through visual thinking and learning based on a pattern language, which leads to free-spirited creativity at all organisational levels.","2022","2025-03-12 00:49:24","2025-03-12 00:49:24","","","","","","","","","EuroPLoP '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Graz, Austria","","","","Business processes; pattern language structure; visual learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is often extended to handle domain-specific processes or enhance the language itself. Problem: Applications of process-oriented approaches have reached new challenging, knowledge-intensive scenarios, such as healthcare, case management, and others. For these scenarios, it is common to observe functions involving collaborative resources and processes that are little structured, which do not have the same level of predictability as a structured work routine. This fact led to the definition of a new class of business processes, Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIP). Solution: This paper investigates which requirements related to the modeling of KIP are met by the standard BPMN language and its extensions proposed in the literature. IS Theory: The paper explores the interaction between Structured Process Modeling Theory and Organizational Information Processing Theory applied to the context of business process management, especially related to knowledge-intensive processes in organizations. Method: We performed an analysis of the adherence of standard BPMN to the KIP modeling requirements and a systematic literature review identifying BPMN extensions, analyzing these proposals regarding their adherence to the same requirements. Summarization of Results: Twelve BPMN extensions were analyzed and compared according to a set of criteria. These extensions were obtained from the SCOPUS digital library and guided the conduct of the research. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: This paper is the first evaluation of BPMN and its extensions regarding KIP requirements. Moreover, we identified the main trends in the development of BPMN extensions related to KIP and some opportunities for future researches.","2023","2025-03-12 00:49:24","2025-03-12 00:49:24","","451–458","","","","","","","SBSI '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Maceió, Brazil","","","","BPMN; BPMN Extension; Business Process Model; Knowledge-Intensive Process; Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
